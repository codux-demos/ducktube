### Take it for a Spin

This project, created by [codeSTACKr](https://www.youtube.com/@codeSTACKr), replicates a YouTube user interface, and it comes with an instructional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkq2PIOAnrU). To modify the components that compose the interface, follow the tutorial video along with the code in this project. 

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Learn how to edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
- Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.

This project was built by a third-party, and Wix assumes no liability for this project.
